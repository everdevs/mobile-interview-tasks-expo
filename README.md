# Mobile Engineer Challenge
A basic [Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/) application with a series of challenges to complete.

## Setup

### Install the Expo CLI
```bash
# Install the command line tools
npm install --global expo-cli 
```

### Check for local emulators
We will ideally want to develop against either an iOS or Android emulator that Expo will hook into. As a mobile engineer, we assume you already have these set up on your machine. See [iOS simulator docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) or [Android Emulator docs](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) if needed.

### Run the local dev environment
This will open a localhost page for logging and with options to run in an emulator.

```bash
yarn start
```
